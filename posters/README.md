# Posters & Preprints Workspace

Use this folder to track poster drafts, submission packets, and preprint notes
before they move to OSF or conference portals. Nothing confidential should live
in git—store only metadata, outlines, and links to the actual files.

## Workflow
1. Create a subfolder per artifact (e.g., `posters/2025_APA_phq9_trends`).
2. Keep the actual PDF/PPTX on encrypted storage or OSF; link to it in
   `catalog.md`.
3. Drop abstracts, outlines, or figure thumbnails here if they are safe for git.
4. Update `catalog.md` whenever the status, venue, or links change so the
   PortfolioHub stays current.

See `posters/catalog.md` for the running list of artifacts.
